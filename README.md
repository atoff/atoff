I'm a aerospace design engineering student from Cambridge, United Kingdom, but learning out of Bristol. In addition to my studies, I am a passionate programmer and although I tend to work on web projects, I enjoy dabbling in mobile/desktop applications. 

Feel free to check out my open source projects, and get in touch if you have any questions!
